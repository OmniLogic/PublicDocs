## Introduction

Sales API provides a set of tools that can be used in several projects to humanize the selling process.

We believe that vending should be effortless.

## Authorization

All API requests require the use of a generated API key. Please contact Omnilogic to get your API key.

To authenticate an API request, you should provide your API key in the `Authorization` header.
